Spin a EC2 instance and login .
Become a root user
Install Java : amazon-linux-extras install java-openjdk11 -y
Install tomcat :
cd /opt
wget https://dlcdn.apache.org/tomcat/tomcat-9/v9.0.71/bin/apache-tomcat-9.0.71.tar.gz
tar -xvzf apache-tomcat-9.0.71.tar.gz
mv apache-tomcat-9.0.71 tomcat (This means that you have renamed the entire unzipped & untarred file with tomcat)
rm -rf apache-tomcat-9.0.62.tar.gz
cd tomcat/bin
./startup.sh

check your machine on port <public-ip>:8080 (#Copied from the AWS instance, it is the same for Tomcat and Jenkins)
#You get a message on the internet that "If you are seeing this, you have successfully installed Tomcat"

#When you click the manager's app at the right and get an error message, read this error message bcs you will have to edit the "Manager's context.xml file", 
change the file called "conf/tomcat-users.xml"by adding a rolename, username and a password.

#In gitbash, exit to cd /opt location using cd .., you can see from the opt folder that the tomcat file is owned by the root user
chown -R ec2-user:ec2-user tomcat/ (This changes the user from root to ec2-user )

find / -name context.xml (#In the opt folder)
# you will find 4 different files with the context.xml. Check all 4 files using nano as below, any file that has any restriction on IP addresses should be commented
out. (This shows that IP addresses that do not start with a certain number as stated within the valve code should not be allowed to run) 
# An example is typing "<!--" about 2 spaces before <Valve and "-->" about 1 space after /> ,on the same code as the Valve.
You can also delete everything between allow=" and " and input the IP address you have for your AWS instance instead of commenting the statement out.

nano /opt/tomcat/conf/context.xml
nano /opt/tomcat/webapps/examples/META-INF/context.xml
nano /opt/tomcat/webapps/host-manager/META-INF/context.xml
nano /opt/tomcat/webapps/manager/META-INF/context.xml

cd ..
In the tomcat folder, use ls -l to confirm that there is a conf folder
cd conf/
nano tomcat-users.xml
# Either you uncomment or comment out from role in the 1st line to role1 in the 5th line or you input the lines below between [role1"/>] and [</tomcat-users>]

================================================================================================================
<role rolename="manager-gui"/>
<role rolename="manager-script"/>
<role rolename="manager-jmx"/>
<role rolename="manager-status"/>
<user username="tomcat" password="pass123" roles="manager-gui"/>
<user username="admin" password="admin123" roles="manager-gui, manager-script, manager-jmx, manager-status"/>
================================================================================================================
cd ../bin
./shutdown.sh to shutdown

./startup.sh to restart
# You can now try logging into Tomcat on the internet using the IP address

(cd /opt/tomcat/bin before using ./shutdown.sh to shutdown
./startup.sh ==> Tomcat should be up and running.)
This is not necessarily important
